An app I made using Node/Express and the Stripe API to sell a digital product on my own terms (no Shopify or anything like that).

I'm still using my test API keys so feel free to use "4242 4242 4242 4242" as your CC info in order to "buy" the product.

I used Heroku as my deployment solution- it can be viewed live here: https://frozen-earth-23441.herokuapp.com/

If you'd like to dig deeper feel free to clone it and run "npm build && npm start."

This app can be thought of as bare-bones template for the sale of any digital product.
